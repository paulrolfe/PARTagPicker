# PARTagPicker

This pod provides a view controller for choosing and creating tags in the style of wordpress or tumblr. This tag picker was originally used in the [Intrepid Pursuits](http://intrepid.io) app, Slate.

## Installation

PARTagPicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PARTagPicker'
```

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the PRTagPicker directory first.

Include `#import <PARTagPicker/PARTagPickerViewController.h>`.

The basic setup is to create an instance of `PARTagPickerViewController`, add it's view, and then add the controller as a child view controller.

The tags are passed in as `PARTag` objects in an array. Anytime you change the `allTags` array, any existing `chosenTags` are updated to use references to the new objects if they contain a match in the updated array. Otherwise they continue to point to the old objects.

The `PARTag` objects allows to configure the color for each of the tags (colorReference), but a global configuration can be defined for all remaining cases. If none is provided then a default configuration is used.

## Options
* You can customize colors using a PARTagColorReference object.
* You can allow new tags with `allowsNewTags` boolean property on the controller.
* You can set the `chosenTags` directly.
* Delegate methods for when the chosenTags change and the tag picker changes size.
* `- (void)tagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker visibilityChangedToState:(PARTagPickerVisibilityState)state `
* `- (void)chosenTagsWereUpdatedInTagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker`
* `tapToEraseTags` Defaults to YES. If set to NO, tapping a cell will just select it (not delete it).
* `placeholderText` - The default text to have as placeholder text in each tag cell. Default value is @"Add a tag".

## Notes

This is still a work in progress. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please create an issue on git or tweet me [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe).

## Updates
* v1.1.0 - Added properties for `placeholderText` and `tapToEraseTags`.
* v1.0.4 - Enabled for use in swift pods.
* v1.0.2 - Including `.xib`s in the pod now. Oops!
* v1.0.0 - Added documentation and fixed bug with deselecting chosenTags. Added ability to use custom fonts in the tag cells.
* v0.0.5 - Added expected functionality of chosenTags being removed when pressed.
